# My website adamkumlin.se

I initially created this website in feburary of 2022 using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Then, in december the same year, I really got into React. I wanted to try to build a website with React and I did so for about 3 months. As the codebase grew larger and larger I ran into problems concerning JavaScript, and by then I had already heard of TypeScript for a while. So in match 2023 I decided to migrate to TypeScript, followed by Next.js and it has worked flawlessly so far. I really love TypeScript, it makes me a more effective developer.
